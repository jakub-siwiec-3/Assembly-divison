# Assembly division

This project implements the `mdiv` function in assembly, which performs integer division with remainder. The function is designed to be called from C and processes a dividend stored in a little-endian array of 64-bit integers. The function computes the quotient and remainder of the division and stores the quotient in the provided array.
